**Forsaken Realms** is a dark fantasy adventure roleplaying game based on [Cairn](https://cairnrpg.com/) about exploring mysterious realms of ruin filled with strange folk, hidden treasure, and unfathomable horrors. Powerful factions vie for power in lawless realms of ruin. Character generation is quick and narrative driven, adventures are tense and reward careful exploration, and combat is frantic and deadly. The game was written by [Julian Davasligil](https://github.com/jdavasligil), derivative of the work written by [Yochai Gal](https://newschoolrevolution.com/).

This game is designed to make it easy for Gamemasters to run [West Marches](https://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/) style campaigns with player driven, emergent narratives.
