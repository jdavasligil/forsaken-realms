**Forsaken Realms** is a dark fantasy adventure roleplaying game for one or more facilitators (the **Referee**) and at least one other player. Players act as hardened adventurers exploring mysterious ruins and forsaken realms filled with strange folk, hidden treasure, and unfathomable horrors.

## Overview
**Forsaken Realms** was written with the following design philosophies in mind:

### Neutrality
The Referee's role is to facilitate the game by portraying the rules, situations, NPCs, and narrative clearly, while acting as a neutral arbiter.

### Classless
A character's role and skills are not defined by a single class. Instead, the equipment they carry and their experiences define their specialty.

### Death
Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm. Death is always lurking, but it is never without warning. Players always have a chance.

### Fiction First
Success and failure are arbitrated by the Referee in dialogue with the players, based on in-world elements. Dice are not always necessary.

### Growth
Characters gain new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events, overcoming obstacles, and making discoveries in-world.

### Player Choice
Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they've made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.

### Principles
The Referee and the players each have guidelines to help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and emergent narrative.

### Shared Objectives
Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.

## Principles for Referees

### Information
* Provide useful information about the game world as the characters explore it freely.
* Players do not need to roll dice to learn about their circumstances.
* Be helpful and direct with your answers to their questions.
* Respond honestly, describe consistently, and always let them know they can keep asking questions.

### Difficulty
* Rely on context and verisimilitude rather than numbers and mechanics.
* If something the players want to do is sincerely impossible, no roll will allow them to do it.
* Is what the player describes and how they leverage the situation sensible? Let it happen.
* Saves cover a great deal of uncertain situations and are often all that is necessary for risky actions.

### Preparation
* The game world is organic, malleable and procedural. Only prepare what is needed.
* Use random generators, tables, and faction interests to develop situations, not plots.
* NPCs remember what the PCs say and do, and how they affect the world.
* Infuse NPCs self-interest, desires, and will to live into their personalities.

### Narrative Focus
* Emergent experience of play is what matters, not arithmetic or character builds. Provide weapon trainers, factions, and personal quests to facilitate advancement.
* Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players, then put realistic opportunities in their path.
* A dagger to your throat will kill you, regardless of your expensive armor and impressive training.

### Danger
* The game world produces real risk of death and suffering for the player characters.
* Telegraph serious danger to players when it is present. The more dangerous, the more obvious.
* Put traps in plain sight and let the players take time to figure out a solution.
* Give players opportunities to solve problems and interact with the world.

### Treasure
* A Treasure is specific to the environment from where it is recovered. It tells a story.
* Treasure is highly valuable, almost always bulky, and rarely useful beyond its worth and prestige.
* Relics are not Treasure, though they are useful and interesting.
* Use Treasure as a lure to exotic locations under the protection of intimidating foes.

### Choice
* Give players a solid choice to force outcomes when the situation lulls.
* Use binary "so, A or B?" responses when their intentions are vague.
* Work together using this conversational method to keep the game moving.
* Ensure that the player character's actions leave their mark on the game world.

### Die of Fate
* Occasionally you will want a quick element of randomness (e.g. the weather, an NPC decision, etc).
* In these situations, roll 1d6. A roll of 4 or more is favors the players.
* A roll of 3 or under means bad luck for the PCs or their allies.
