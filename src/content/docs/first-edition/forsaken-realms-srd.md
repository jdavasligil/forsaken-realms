# Forsaken Realms System Reference Document (v1.0.0)

**Forsaken Realms** is licensed under [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)

**Forsaken Realms** is a dark fantasy adventure role-playing game for one or more facilitators (the **Game Master** or **GM**) and at least one other player. Players act as hardened adventurers exploring mysterious ruins and forsaken realms filled with strange folk, hidden treasure, and unfathomable horrors.

## Design Philosophy
**Forsaken Realms** was written with the following design philosophies in mind:

#### Neutrality
The GM's role is to facilitate the game by portraying the rules, situations, NPCs, and narrative clearly, while acting as a neutral arbiter.

#### Classless
A character's role and skills are not defined by a single class. Instead, the equipment they carry and their experiences define their specialty.

#### Death
Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm. Death is always lurking, but it is never without warning. Players always have a chance.

#### Fiction First
Success and failure are arbitrated by the GM in dialogue with the players, based on in-world elements. Dice are not always necessary.

#### Growth
Characters gain new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events, overcoming obstacles, and making discoveries in-world.

#### Player Choice
Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they've made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.

#### Principles
The GM and the players each have guidelines to help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and emergent narrative.

#### Shared Objectives
Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.


## Principles for Game Masters

#### Information
- Provide useful information about the game world as the characters explore it freely.
- Players do not need to roll dice to learn about their circumstances.
- Be helpful and direct with your answers to their questions.
- Respond honestly, describe consistently, and always let them know they can keep asking questions.

#### Difficulty
- Rely on context and verisimilitude rather than numbers and mechanics.
- If something the players want to do is sincerely impossible, no roll will allow them to do it.
- Is what the player describes and how they leverage the situation sensible? Let it happen.
- Saves cover a great deal of uncertain situations and are often all that is necessary for risky actions.

#### Preparation
- The game world is organic, malleable and procedural. Only prepare what is needed.
- Use random generators, tables, and faction interests to develop situations, not plots.
- NPCs remember what the PCs say and do, and how they affect the world.
- Infuse NPCs self-interest, desires, and will to live into their personalities.

#### Narrative Focus
- Emergent experience of play is what matters, not arithmetic or character builds. Provide weapon trainers, factions, and personal quests to facilitate advancement.
- Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players, then put realistic opportunities in their path.
- A dagger to your throat will kill you, regardless of your expensive armor and impressive training.

#### Danger
- The game world produces real risk of death and suffering for the player characters.
- Telegraph serious danger to players when it is present. The more dangerous, the more obvious.
- Put traps in plain sight and let the players take time to figure out a solution.
- Give players opportunities to solve problems and interact with the world.


#### Treasure
- A Treasure is specific to the environment from where it is recovered. It tells a story.
- Treasure is highly valuable, almost always bulky, and rarely useful beyond its worth and prestige.
- Relics are not Treasure, though they are useful and interesting.
- Use Treasure as a lure to exotic locations under the protection of intimidating foes.

#### Choice
- Give players a solid choice to force outcomes when the situation lulls.
- Use binary "so, A or B?" responses when their intentions are vague.
- Work together using this conversational method to keep the game moving.
- Ensure that the player character's actions leave their mark on the game world.

#### Die of Fate
- Occasionally you will want a quick element of randomness (e.g. the weather, an NPC decision, etc).
- In these situations, roll 1d6. A roll of 4 or more favors the players.
- A roll of 3 or under means bad luck for the PCs or their allies.


## Principles for Players

#### Agency
- Attributes and related saves do not define your character. They are tools.
- Don't ask only what your character would do, ask what you would do, too.
- Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections.

#### Teamwork
- Seek consensus from the other players before barreling forward.
- Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other and accomplishing more as a group than alone.
- Work to build camaraderie with your fellow players by considering their needs as well as your own.

#### Exploration
- Asking questions and listening to detail is more useful than any stats, items, or skills you have.
- Take the GM's description without suspicion, but don't shy away from seeking more information.
- There is no single correct way forward.

#### Talking
- Treat NPCs as if they were real people, and rely on your curiosity to safely gain information and solve problems.
- You'll find that most people are interesting and will want to talk things through before getting violent.

#### Caution
- Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence is the best way to achieve your goals.
- Try to stack the odds in your favor and retreat when things seem unfavorable.
- Rely on your wits and your allies to persevere.

#### Planning
- Think of ways to overcome your obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding.
- Do some research and ask around about your objectives.
- Know thy enemy. Monsters can be truly terrifying, dangerous creatures, but all have a weakness.

#### Ambition
- Set goals, share them with your GM, and use your meager means to take steps forward.
- Expect nothing for free. Earn your reputation.
- Keep things moving forward and play to see what happens.


## Character Creation

#### Attributes
Player Characters (PCs) have three attributes:  
**(M)ight**, **(A)gility** and **(W)ill**, referred together as **MAW**. When creating a PC, the player rolls 3d6 and drops the lowest die for each of their character's ability scores in order, down the line. They may swap any two of the results. Higher is better.

Attributes are used to make saves against hazardous and deadly consequences.

 Ada rolls for her character's <b>MIG</b>, resulting in a <b>2</b>, a <b>4</b>, and a <b>6</b>, totaling <b>10</b> after dropping the lowest value. The next three ability rolls result in a <b>6</b> for <b>AGI</b>, and a <b>7</b> for <b>WIL</b>. She decides to swap the <b>10</b> and the <b>6</b>, for a character with <b>6 MIG</b>, <b>10 AGI</b>, and <b>7 WIL</b> (6/10/7 <b>MAW</b>).
</details>

#### Hit Dice
Player Characters begin with 1 hit die (d6), and gain one each level. Hit dice are all rerolled at the start of each adventuring day. The total is the maximum **hit protection (HP)** you have for the day. 

Hit protection represents a combination of stamina, luck, and resilience, not health. This is your character's ability to avoid serious damage.

#### Background
Who were you and why are you here?

Your background is of the form:  
\[**Reputation** (Adjective) + **Background** (Noun)\] who was \[**Misfortune** (Verb, past participle)\]. E.g. **Unreliable** **alchemist** who was badly **burned**.

Let this brief description spark your imagination.

This is your identity before seeking a new life in the forsaken realm. Outside of role-play, it is used by the GM to determine what your character is proficient at.

  <summary>
Expand For Example
  </summary>
Ada decides her character was an <b>honest sailor</b> who was <b>cursed</b>.

Her imagination fills the gaps: the PC paid no heed to the old superstitions and cursed the lord of the deep after losing a close mate in a storm. The crew then suffered a bout of misfortune, soon blaming the PC. Eventually, the PC was marooned and left to die. The dread lord of the sea had cursed and abandoned her. Surviving for months off of crab and seaweed, they eventually crafted a makeshift raft which delivered her, after much turmoil, back to land.
</details>

#### Traits
Answer the following prompts in single words or terse sentences:

Briefly describe your character's **appearance**. Note their physique, skin texture, hair, face, and clothing. Be sure to have one unique distinguishing feature.

What is their ultimate **ambition**? What do they hope to accomplish in the forsaken realm?

What is their most dreaded **fear**? What keeps them up at night?

Name their darkest **secret**? What are they afraid to reveal?

With the background sorted, Ada has a pretty good idea about how to answer the character trait questionnaire.

<b>Appearance</b>: Rugged looking with sea weathered skin. She has long greasy black hair, a bony face, old linens with a torn red doublet, a straw hat, and a distinctive tattoo of a serpent wrapping around the arm with fangs bared on the hand.

<b>Ambition</b>: Gain the power to defy the gods and overcome the dread lord's curse.

<b>Fear</b>: Losing another friend. Associated with dark water.

<b>Secret</b>: My courage is all an act. Deep down I am truly terrified.
</details>

#### Starting Equipment
Player characters begin with nothing but the clothes on their back, two items from their **background**, and an heirloom **trinket**. Characters entering the forsaken realms are unfortunate souls who have lost or given up most of their possessions.

#### Name
Lastly, name your character.

## TODO: How to Play
### Required Materials
### Roles
### Running the Game
### Roleplaying

## Rules
### Abilities
Each of the three **abilities (MAW)** are used in different circumstances.

**(M)ight:** Used for saves requiring physical power. E.g. lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.

**(A)gility:** Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes. E.g. dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.

**(W)ill:** Used for saves requiring the force of will or mental fortitude. E.g. casting spells, binding a demon, resisting charm, or holding on to sanity.

### TODO: Advancement

### Saves
A **save** is a roll made to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and circumstances.

To make a MAW save, roll a d20. A result less than or equal to your MAW score is a success where higher is better. Rolling above your MAW score is a failure. However, a result of 20 always succeeds, and a result of 1 always fails. 

A save is only rolled when the GM makes a call for it. Saves are typically made in response to player decisions.

A result of 20 is the best possible outcome, and puts your player character in a better position.
Conversely, a result of 1 is the worst possible outcome, and puts your player character in a worse position.

  <summary>
Expand For Example
  </summary>
<b>GM</b>: The red dragon takes a deep breath, and then bellows out a stream of blazing fire towards you!<br>
<b>Ada</b>: I raise my fireproof shield Dragonsbane and block the blast!<br>
<b>GM</b>: Excellent, make a Might save. Baldo?<br>
<b>Baldo</b>: I dive out of the way and take cover behind the pillar.<br>
<b>GM</b>: Very well, make an Agility save. How about you Clare?<br>
<b>Clare</b>: I open my grimoire and call upon the daemon Ignon to protect me from the flames.<br>
<b>GM</b>: Interesting. Make a Will save!<br>
</details>

### Pushing Rolls
If you roll above your MAW score but less than 20, the GM may give you the option to **push** the roll.

In this case, the GM presents the stakes: often losing an item, taking critical damage, or death. The stakes are always more dire than the cost of ordinary failure.

If you choose to push the roll, then roll again and take the new result. If you succeed, then you may give an ally **inspiration**. If you fail, then suffer the consequences.

**Note**. You may only make one push attempt per roll.

### Advantage & Disadvantage
When making a roll with **advantage**, roll two dice and take the better result. For **disadvantage**, take the worse result. Advantage and disadvantage is granted by the GM based on circumstance and clever play.

### Free Rerolls
When making a free reroll, you must accept the new result.

### Inspiration
Inspiration can be used to get a free reroll on any MAW save or skill roll.

You either have inspiration, or not. It is lost at the end of each session. Inspiration is granted by players who succeed a pushed roll, and also at the end of each session to the most valued player, in which case they begin their day with it.

### Rest & Recovery
#### Short Rest
Resting for one turn and having a drink of water allows you to spend a number of hit dice to recover HP. Choose how many you wish to spend and roll them. The total is the amount of HP recovered.

You may perform light activity while resting such as tending to wounds, studying an arcane object, or having a conversation.

#### Long Rest
Eating a meal and getting a full nights rest with few interruptions recovers all hit dice and HP.

Maximum HP for the day is determined by rerolling all hit dice to see how well you rested. Bonus hit dice may be awarded by various circumstances which are added to the pool rolled. Drop a number of low dice equal to the number of bonus dice added.

### Healing
#### Natural Healing
Critical damage to attributes requires extended periods of downtime to recover on its own. You recover 1d3 to each attribute for every week of rest. Applying natural remedies and doing nothing else during downtime increases recovery speed to 1d6.

#### Magical Healing
There are some who claim to be able to perform miracles. Most are charlatans and peddlers of cheap tricks.

However, one may occasion upon a true practitioner of theurgical or thaumaturgical healing. Beware! Magic is dangerous, unpredictable, and always has a cost.

True alchemist's potions or elixirs are rare and coveted, and typically come with unusual side effects. Powerful potions can maim, disfigure, or outright kill the imbiber.

### Fatigue
A PC deprived of a crucial need such as food or rest is unable to recover HP, hit dice, or ability scores. Anyone deprived for more than a day adds **Fatigue** to their inventory, one for each day.

Each Fatigue occupies one inventory slot and lasts until they are able to take a long rest. PCs can also gain Fatigue by casting spells or other various circumstances.

### Defense Rating
Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target's **Defense Rating (DR)** from the result of damage rolls.

Wearing armor and performing defensive actions such as **parrying** adds to one's DR.

### Reactions
When PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the GM may roll 2d6. Higher results indicate a more positive and helpful reaction. Lower results are more negative, wary, or outright hostile.

### Morale
Creatures must pass a Will save to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty, and again when they lose half their number.

Organized groups use their leader's Will in place of their own. Lone foes must save when they're reduced to 0 HP.

Morale does not apply to PCs.

### Hirelings
PCs can hire **hirelings** to aid them in their expeditions. Hirelings are NPCs offering adventuring services. They can either be paid per day or by portion of share.

##### Cost
| Level | Cost (gp / day) | Cost (share) |
| :---: | :-------------: | :----------: |
|   1   |      1--3       |     1/8      |
|   2   |      2--6       |     1/4      |
|   3   |      3--8       |     1/3      |
|   4   |      5--12      |     1/2      |
|   5   |     10--24      |      1       |

**Note.** A share is the amount equally divided among all members of a party. A fraction share is calculated as a fraction of one's whole share, the remaining being distributed equally to the rest of the party.

### Wealth & Treasure
The most common coin is the gold piece (gp), which is equal to 10 silver pieces (sp) and 100 copper pieces (cp).

Treasure is highly valuable, usually bulky, and rarely of practical use. It can be a hook taking PCs to exotic and dangerous locations, and is often protected by deadly foes.

Villages, strongholds, and ports of call barter and trade based on the local rarity and value of an item or commodity.

### Magic & The Occult
Magic is immensely powerful, unpredictable, and often dangerous. It has caused the rise and fall of many an empire; the destruction of entire peoples and continents; and also, many intelligent and foolhardy souls driven to great madness and despair.

While many have a dabbling curiousity in the occult, few are brave or mad enough to dedicate their lives in its pursuit. Most kingdoms view magic with great suspicion, even those who enjoy its benefits. Many outlaw its practice completely, having been scorned by the dreadful powers of dark sorcery.

#### Spells
A spell is a ritual which, when performed, invokes an otherworldly power to produce an effect. Spells require a sacrifice to grant the entity power, and some way of channeling the evocator's Will: typically by speaking words of power, making arcane gestures, or drawing arcane symbols. This practice is called evocation.

#### Grimoires
**Grimoires** are magical books that contain a single powerful spell and take up one inventory slot. They cannot be transcribed or created. Instead, they are recovered from ancient and secret places like tombs, dungeons, and lost temples.

Grimoires often display unusual properties or limitations, such as producing a foul or unearthly smell when opened, possessing an innate intelligence, or being legible only when held in moonlight. Some may contain dangerous, forbidden knowledge that may drive the reader mad.

Grimoires will attract the attention of those who seek the arcane power within, and it is considered dangerous to display them openly.

##### Grimoire Examples
| Title | Properties | Ritual | Effect |
| ----- | ---------- | ------ | ------ |
| Book of the Dead | Smells sickly sweet and musty. Hear the cries of lost souls when openned. | Sacrifice 1 year of your life for each soul summoned. Draw the symbols of life and death, and speak the words of binding. (2 rounds) | Raise the dead, binding a lost soul within their corpus to your will. Upon failure, gain Fatigue and lose control over the undead. |
| Book of the Faerie King | Smells like your favorite scent. Hear the faint sound of a servant bell when opened. | Light a candle and read the call of the faerie king, then blow it out to summon a faerie servant. Sacrifice that which the faerie servant desires most. | Be granted a single powerful faerie spell or service, agreed upon in advance. On failure, the faerie twists the words of the contract against you. |
| Book of Hellfire | Smells like sulfur. Hot to the touch. Smoke rises from the pages. | Sacrifice a source of flame. Draw the symbol of fire with the flame and then throw it on the ground with force while reading the incantation. | Summon a 10' wide whirling pillar of flame that deals 3d6 damage to all who touch it and moves at your command for up to 10 rounds. On failure, lose control of the hellfire pillar. It moves in a random direction every round. |
| Book of the Worm | Smells of earth and decay. Causes hallucinations of worms beneath the skin and a craving for flesh. | Mix your blood with that of an innocent vampire, sacrificing both of your souls. Then, sing the hymn of the worm to call upon him. (3 rounds) | Summon the ancient god of decay, blacking out the sun. Upon failure, be consumed by the old one. On success, gain the power of an ancient vampire and black out the sun. |

#### Scrolls
**Scrolls** are similar to grimoires, however they do not take up an inventory slot and turn to dust after one use.

##### TODO: Examples

#### Casting Spells
Anyone can cast a spell, given they understand it, by making the appropriate sacrifice and reading its contents out loud while performing the specified ritual.

Each spell has a casting time, which tells you how many rounds of combat are required to complete the ritual, typically 1--3.

Spellcasting must be declared at the beginning of the round. You can not move while casting.

Spells are released at the start of the next round, and require the caster to make a Will save to maintain control. The consequence of failure is dependent on the spell. It may cause Fatigue, critical damage, destruction of the book, or even death.

#### Relics
**Relics** are rare magical items imbued with magical power. They can be activated at will, but have a limited use (1--3 charges) and require a ritual to recharge the item.

##### TODO: Examples

### Combat
Combat follows the same flow as exploration. The GM describes the situation, and the players declare what they would like to do. There is no initiative system.

#### Actions
Player characters can perform one action each round of combat, with the exception of ready actions which do not count as your action for the round.

Actions can be fast or slow. A fast action can be completed in a few seconds, whereas a slow action takes the full round.

#### Rounds
A **round** of combat is roughly ten seconds of in-game time.

After the GM has described the situation and players have declared their intentions, the round progresses simultaneously in logical order using the following phases as a guideline:

##### 1. Ready Actions
At the top of the round, resolve any spells that are ready. Most spells take 1 round of casting before they are ready.

Handle any other immediately ready actions. For example, an aimed crossbow, or a held portcullis lever ready to be released.

##### 2. Fast Actions
Next, resolve any fast actions. Kicking open a door in front of you, drawing and shooting a bow without moving, etc.

##### 3. Movement
Everyone moves simultaenously. It is an Agility or Might save to tumble or shove past an enemy.

##### 4. Slow Actions
Last, handle any actions that take significant time. Engaging an enemy in melee, reloading a crossbow, quaffing a potion, taking careful aim, etc.

##### 5. Morale
Remember to test each group's morale by rolling a Will save on the first enemy casualty, and again when they lose half their number.

#### Attacking & Damage
The attacker rolls their attack die. The amount exceeding the Defense Rating (DR) of the opponent is dealt to their HP.

Unarmed attacks do 1d4 damage by default.

#### Attack Modifiers
If fighting from a position of weakness (e.g. through cover or with bound hands), the attack is **impaired** and the attacker must roll 1d4 damage as their attack die.

If fighting from a position of strength (e.g. against a restrained foe or unaware target), the attack is **enhanced**, allowing the attacker to roll 1d12 damage as their attack die.

#### Area of Effect (AoE)
Attacks with an **area of effect (AoE)** quality affect all targets in the noted area, rolling separately for each affected character.

The number of targets affected can be determined by rolling the related attack die.

#### Critical Damage
Damage that reduces a target's HP below zero decreases a target's MAW by the remaining amount. Physical attacks are dealt to Might or Agility, depending on the attacker's goal. Mental attacks are dealt to Will.

The target must then make a MAW save for the attribute targeted with the reduced score to avoid **critical damage**. Special abilities from Aspects may be triggered when a target fails their critical damage save.

A character that suffers critical damage has a serious injury. Critical damage to Might needs to be stabilized. If left untreated, they die in 1d6 exploration turns.

Critical damage to Agility renders the target immobile until a short rest. Critical damage to Will sends the target into shock, leaving them catatonic for 1d4 rounds.

#### Ability Score Loss
If a PC's Might is reduced to 0, they die. If Agility is reduced to 0, they are paralyzed. If Will is reduced to 0, they are delirious. Complete loss of A/W renders the character unable to act until restored through extended rest or by extraordinary means.

#### Reach
Weapons with a reach advantage always apply their damage first.

#### Retreat
Running away from combat requires a successful Agility save and a safe destination to run to.

#### Units
Large groups of similar combatants fighting together are treated as a single **unit**. When a unit takes critical damage, it is routed or significantly weakened. When it reaches 0 Might, it is destroyed.

Attacks against units by individuals are **impaired**, excluding AoE damage.

Attacks against individuals by units are **enhanced** and deal AoE damage.

### TODO: Condition

### Death
When a character dies, the player is free to take control of a hireling or roll a new character. The new character joins the party immediately.

### Distance
Distances are measured roughly as **close**, **near**, and **far**. If something is close, it is within about 10' and can be reached immediately. If something is near, it is within about 30' and requires movement to reach. Otherwise it is considered far away.

In encounters, characters can move near distances.

### Speed
Movement speed is equal to your Agility score.

#### Tactical Movement
If using a grid, your speed is the number of squares you can move. When moving diagonally, alternate 1--2--1 while counting distance to account for the extra length.

### Time
Encounters proceed by **rounds** which are roughly 10 seconds.

Exploration on foot proceeds by **turns** which comprise roughly 10 minutes.

Overland travel proceeds by **watches** which represent roughly 1 hour.

### Exploration
When exploring an area on foot, the GM must keep track of real time. At the end of every turn, check for wandering monsters and ask players to roll for condition on any light sources.

Players must decide the marching order for their characters. The PC in front is the **caller** and decides where to lead the party.

One player should elect to be the **mapper**. Their goal is to prevent the party from getting lost, by keeping a rough map of the area as the GM describes it.

#### Mapping Techniques
It is often sufficient to use dots for rooms and lines for corridors. Triangles can represent stairs, dashes for doors, and three dots for gates. A small circle on a door is a lock. Use numbers for rooms and letters for connecting maps together. Now, it is possible to make a key for important rooms and jot quick notes.

#### Wandering Monsters
To check for **wandering monsters** roll X-in-6. The default chance is 2-in-6, but may be lower in safer regions or higher in more dangerous ones.

A table should be made for the area containing a mix of hostile, neutral, and even friendly creatures that can be found wandering. When a wandering monster occurs, roll on the table to determine what monster is near.

#### Light Condition
To check for light condition, roll a d6. If the result exceeds the condition rating (1--5), mark a use on the item. After three uses, the light goes out.

##### Light Duration
| Condition Rating | Expected Duration |
| :--------------: | :---------------: |
|         1        | 3 Turns           |
|         2        | 4 Turns           |
|         3        | 6 Turns           |
|         4        | 9 Turns           |
|         5        | 18 Turns          |

### TODO: Overland Travel
