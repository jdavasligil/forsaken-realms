# Forsaken Realms System Reference Document (v1.0.0)

**Forsaken Realms** is licensed under [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)

**Forsaken Realms** is a dark fantasy adventure role-playing game for one or more facilitators (the **Game Master** or **GM**) and at least one other player. Players act as hardened adventurers exploring mysterious ruins and forsaken realms filled with strange folk, hidden treasure, and unfathomable horrors.

## Design Philosophy
**Forsaken Realms** was written with the following design philosophies in mind:

#### Neutrality
The GM's role is to facilitate the game by portraying the rules, situations, NPCs, and narrative clearly, while acting as a neutral arbiter.

#### Classless
A character's role and skills are not defined by a single class. Instead, the equipment they carry and their experiences define their specialty.

#### Death
Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm. Death is always lurking, but it is never without warning. Players always have a chance.

#### Fiction First
Success and failure are arbitrated by the GM in dialogue with the players, based on in-world elements. Dice are not always necessary.

#### Growth
Characters gain new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events, overcoming obstacles, and making discoveries in-world.

#### Player Choice
Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they've made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.

#### Principles
The GM and the players each have guidelines to help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and emergent narrative.

#### Shared Objectives
Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.


## Principles for Game Masters

#### Information
- Provide useful information about the game world as the characters explore it freely.
- Players do not need to roll dice to learn about their circumstances.
- Be helpful and direct with your answers to their questions.
- Respond honestly, describe consistently, and always let them know they can keep asking questions.

#### Difficulty
- Rely on context and verisimilitude rather than numbers and mechanics.
- If something the players want to do is sincerely impossible, no roll will allow them to do it.
- Is what the player describes and how they leverage the situation sensible? Let it happen.
- Saves cover a great deal of uncertain situations and are often all that is necessary for risky actions.

#### Preparation
- The game world is organic, malleable and procedural. Only prepare what is needed.
- Use random generators, tables, and faction interests to develop situations, not plots.
- NPCs remember what the PCs say and do, and how they affect the world.
- Infuse NPCs self-interest, desires, and will to live into their personalities.

#### Narrative Focus
- Emergent experience of play is what matters, not arithmetic or character builds. Provide weapon trainers, factions, and personal quests to facilitate advancement.
- Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players, then put realistic opportunities in their path.
- A dagger to your throat will kill you, regardless of your expensive armor and impressive training.

#### Danger
- The game world produces real risk of death and suffering for the player characters.
- Telegraph serious danger to players when it is present. The more dangerous, the more obvious.
- Put traps in plain sight and let the players take time to figure out a solution.
- Give players opportunities to solve problems and interact with the world.


#### Treasure
- A Treasure is specific to the environment from where it is recovered. It tells a story.
- Treasure is highly valuable, almost always bulky, and rarely useful beyond its worth and prestige.
- Relics are not Treasure, though they are useful and interesting.
- Use Treasure as a lure to exotic locations under the protection of intimidating foes.

#### Choice
- Give players a solid choice to force outcomes when the situation lulls.
- Use binary "so, A or B?" responses when their intentions are vague.
- Work together using this conversational method to keep the game moving.
- Ensure that the player character's actions leave their mark on the game world.

#### Die of Fate
- Occasionally you will want a quick element of randomness (e.g. the weather, an NPC decision, etc).
- In these situations, roll 1d6. A roll of 4 or more favors the players.
- A roll of 3 or under means bad luck for the PCs or their allies.


## Principles for Players

#### Agency
- Attributes and related saves do not define your character. They are tools.
- Don't ask only what your character would do, ask what you would do, too.
- Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections.

#### Teamwork
- Seek consensus from the other players before barreling forward.
- Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other and accomplishing more as a group than alone.
- Work to build camaraderie with your fellow players by considering their needs as well as your own.

#### Exploration
- Asking questions and listening to detail is more useful than any stats, items, or skills you have.
- Take the GM's description without suspicion, but don't shy away from seeking more information.
- There is no single correct way forward.

#### Talking
- Treat NPCs as if they were real people, and rely on your curiosity to safely gain information and solve problems.
- You'll find that most people are interesting and will want to talk things through before getting violent.

#### Caution
- Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence is the best way to achieve your goals.
- Try to stack the odds in your favor and retreat when things seem unfavorable.
- Rely on your wits and your allies to persevere.

#### Planning
- Think of ways to overcome your obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding.
- Do some research and ask around about your objectives.
- Know thy enemy. Monsters can be truly terrifying, dangerous creatures, but all have a weakness.

#### Ambition
- Set goals, share them with your GM, and use your meager means to take steps forward.
- Expect nothing for free. Earn your reputation.
- Keep things moving forward and play to see what happens.


## Character Creation

#### Attributes
Player Characters (PCs) have three attributes:  
**(M)ight**, **(A)gility** and **(W)ill**, referred together as **MAW**. When creating a PC, the player rolls 3d6 and drops the lowest die for each of their character's ability scores in order, down the line. They may swap any two of the results. Higher is better.

Attributes are used to make saves against hazardous and deadly consequences.

 Ada rolls for her character's <b>MIG</b>, resulting in a <b>2</b>, a <b>4</b>, and a <b>6</b>, totaling <b>10</b> after dropping the lowest value. The next three ability rolls result in a <b>6</b> for <b>AGI</b>, and a <b>7</b> for <b>WIL</b>. She decides to swap the <b>10</b> and the <b>6</b>, for a character with <b>6 MIG</b>, <b>10 AGI</b>, and <b>7 WIL</b> (6/10/7 <b>MAW</b>).
</details>

#### Hit Dice
Player Characters begin with 1 hit die (d6), and gain one each level. Hit dice are all rerolled at the start of each adventuring day. The total is the maximum **hit protection (HP)** you have for the day. 

Hit protection represents a combination of stamina, luck, and resilience, not health. This is your character's ability to avoid serious damage.

#### Background
Who were you and why are you here?

Your background is of the form:  
\[**Reputation** (Adjective) + **Background** (Noun)\] who was \[**Misfortune** (Verb, past participle)\]. E.g. **Unreliable** **alchemist** who was badly **burned**.

Let this brief description spark your imagination.

This is your identity before seeking a new life in the forsaken realm. Outside of role-play, it is used by the GM to determine what your character is proficient at.

  </summary>
Ada decides her character was an <b>honest sailor</b> who was <b>cursed</b>.

Her imagination fills the gaps: the PC paid no heed to the old superstitions and cursed the lord of the deep after losing a close mate in a storm. The crew then suffered a bout of misfortune, soon blaming the PC. Eventually, the PC was marooned and left to die. The dread lord of the sea had cursed and abandoned her. Surviving for months off of crab and seaweed, they eventually crafted a makeshift raft which delivered her, after much turmoil, back to land.

#### Traits
Answer the following prompts in single words or terse sentences:

Briefly describe your character's **appearance**. Note their physique, skin texture, hair, face, and clothing. Be sure to have one unique distinguishing feature.

What is their ultimate **ambition**? What do they hope to accomplish in the forsaken realm?

What is their most dreaded **fear**? What keeps them up at night?

Name their darkest **secret**? What are they afraid to reveal?

With the background sorted, Ada has a pretty good idea about how to answer the character trait questionnaire.

<b>Appearance</b>: Rugged looking with sea weathered skin. She has long greasy black hair, a bony face, old linens with a torn red doublet, a straw hat, and a distinctive tattoo of a serpent wrapping around the arm with fangs bared on the hand.

<b>Ambition</b>: Gain the power to defy the gods and overcome the dread lord's curse.

<b>Fear</b>: Losing another friend. Associated with dark water.

<b>Secret</b>: My courage is all an act. Deep down I am truly terrified.
</details>

#### Starting Equipment
Player characters begin with nothing but the clothes on their back, two items from their **background**, and an heirloom **trinket**. Characters entering the forsaken realms are unfortunate souls who have lost or given up most of their possessions.

#### Name
Lastly, name your character.


## Rules
### Abilities
Each of the three **abilities (MAW)** are used in different circumstances.

**(M)ight:** Used for saves requiring physical power. E.g. lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.

**(A)gility:** Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes. E.g. dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc.

**(W)ill:** Used for saves requiring the force of will or mental fortitude. E.g. casting spells, binding a demon, resisting charm, or holding on to sanity.

### Saves
A **save** is a roll made to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and circumstances.

To make a MAW save, roll a d20. A result less than or equal to your MAW score is a success where higher is better. Rolling above your MAW score is a failure. However, a result of 20 always succeeds, and a result of 1 always fails. 

A save is only rolled when the GM makes a call for it. Saves are typically made in response to player decisions.

A result of 20 is the best possible outcome, and puts your player character in a better position.
Conversely, a result of 1 is the worst possible outcome, and puts your player character in a worse position.

<b>Baldo</b>: I dive out of the way and take cover behind the pillar.<br>
<b>GM</b>: Very well, make an Agility save. How about you Clare?<br>
<b>Clare</b>: I open my grimoire and call upon the daemon Ignon to protect me from the flames.<br>
<b>GM</b>: Interesting. Make a Will save!<br>
</details>

### Rest & Recovery
#### Short Rest
Resting for one turn and having a drink of water allows you to spend a number of hit dice to recover HP. Choose how many you wish to spend and roll them. The total is the amount of HP recovered.

You may perform light activity while resting such as tending to wounds, studying an arcane object, or having a conversation.

#### Long Rest
Eating a meal and getting a full nights rest with few interruptions recovers all hit dice and HP.

Maximum HP for the day is determined by rerolling all hit dice to see how well you rested. Bonus hit dice may be awarded by various circumstances which are added to the pool rolled. Drop a number of low dice equal to the number of bonus dice added.

### Healing
#### Natural Healing
Critical damage to attributes requires extended periods of downtime to recover on its own. You recover 1d3 to each attribute for every week of rest. Applying natural remedies and doing nothing else during downtime increases recovery speed to 1d6.

#### Magical Healing
There are some who claim to be able to perform miracles. Most are charlatans and peddlers of cheap tricks.

However, one may occasion upon a true practitioner of theurgical or thaumaturgical healing. Beware! Magic is dangerous, unpredictable, and always has a cost.

True alchemist's potions or elixirs are rare and coveted, and typically come with unusual side effects. Powerful potions can maim, disfigure, or outright kill the imbiber.
