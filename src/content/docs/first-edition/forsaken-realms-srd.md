# Forsaken Realms System Reference Document (v1.0.0)

**Forsaken Realms** is licensed under [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)

**Forsaken Realms** is a dark fantasy adventure role-playing game for one or more facilitators (the **Game Master** or **GM**) and at least one other player. Players act as hardened adventurers exploring mysterious ruins and forsaken realms filled with strange folk, hidden treasure, and unfathomable horrors.

## Design
**Forsaken Realms** was written with the following design philosophies in mind:

### Neutrality
The GM's role is to facilitate the game by portraying the rules, situations, NPCs, and narrative clearly, while acting as a neutral arbiter.

### Classless
A character's role and skills are not defined by a single class. Instead, the equipment they carry and their experiences define their specialty.

### Death
Characters may be powerful, but they are also vulnerable to harm. Death is always lurking, but it is never without warning. Players always have a chance.

### Fiction First
Success and failure are arbitrated by the GM in dialogue with the players, based on in-world elements. Dice are not always necessary.

### Growth
Characters gain new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events, overcoming obstacles, and making discoveries in-world.

### Player Choice
Players should always understand the reasons behind the choices they've made, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.

### Principles
The GM and the players each have guidelines to help foster a specific play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and emergent narrative.

### Shared Objectives
Players trust one another to engage with the shared setting, character goals, and party challenges. Therefore, the party is typically working together towards a common goal, as a team.

## Principles for Game Masters

### Information
- Provide useful information about the game world as the characters explore it freely.
- Players do not need to roll dice to learn about their circumstances.
- Be helpful and direct with your answers to their questions.
- Respond honestly, describe consistently, and always let them know they can keep asking questions.

### Difficulty
- Rely on context and verisimilitude rather than numbers and mechanics.
- If something the players want to do is sincerely impossible, no roll will allow them to do it.
- Is what the player describes and how they leverage the situation sensible? Let it happen.
- Saves cover a great deal of uncertain situations and are often all that is necessary for risky actions.

### Preparation
- The game world is organic, malleable and procedural. Only prepare what is needed.
- Use random generators, tables, and faction interests to develop situations, not plots.
- NPCs remember what the PCs say and do, and how they affect the world.
- Infuse NPCs self-interest, desires, and will to live into their personalities.

### Narrative Focus
- Emergent experience of play is what matters, not arithmetic or character builds. Provide weapon trainers, factions, and personal quests to facilitate advancement.
- Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players, then put realistic opportunities in their path.
- A dagger to your throat will kill you, regardless of your expensive armor and impressive training.

### Danger
- The game world produces real risk of death and suffering for the player characters.
- Telegraph serious danger to players when it is present. The more dangerous, the more obvious.
- Put traps in plain sight and let the players take time to figure out a solution.
- Give players opportunities to solve problems and interact with the world.

### Treasure
- A Treasure is specific to the environment from where it is recovered. It tells a story.
- Treasure is highly valuable, almost always bulky, and rarely useful beyond its worth and prestige.
- Relics are not Treasure, though they are useful and interesting.
- Use Treasure as a lure to exotic locations under the protection of intimidating foes.

### Choice
- Give players a solid choice to force outcomes when the situation lulls.
- Use binary "so, A or B?" responses when their intentions are vague.
- Work together using this conversational method to keep the game moving.
- Ensure that the player character's actions leave their mark on the game world.

### Die of Fate
- Occasionally you will want a quick element of randomness (e.g. the weather, an NPC decision, etc).
- In these situations, roll 1d6. A roll of 4 or more favors the players.
- A roll of 3 or under means bad luck for the PCs or their allies.


## Principles for Players

### Agency
- Attributes and related saves do not define your character. They are tools.
- Don't ask only what your character would do, ask what you would do, too.
- Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections.

### Teamwork
- Seek consensus from the other players before barreling forward.
- Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other and accomplishing more as a group than alone.
- Work to build camaraderie with your fellow players by considering their needs as well as your own.

### Exploration
- Asking questions and listening to detail is more useful than any stats, items, or skills you have.
- Take the GM's description without suspicion, but don't shy away from seeking more information.
- There is no single correct way forward.

### Talking
- Treat NPCs as if they were real people, and rely on your curiosity to safely gain information and solve problems.
- You'll find that most people are interesting and will want to talk things through before getting violent.

### Caution
- Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence is the best way to achieve your goals.
- Try to stack the odds in your favor and retreat when things seem unfavorable.
- Rely on your wits and your allies to persevere.

### Planning
- Think of ways to overcome your obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding.
- Do some research and ask around about your objectives.
- Know thy enemy. Monsters can be truly terrifying, dangerous creatures, but all have a weakness.

### Ambition
- Set goals, share them with your GM, and use your meager means to take steps forward.
- Expect nothing for free. Earn your reputation.
- Keep things moving forward and play to see what happens.
