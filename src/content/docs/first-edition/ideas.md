This is where I keep some of my random ideas for development.

## Advancement
- Mausritter style leveling, capped at level 10
- XP growth curve should make reaching max level very difficult, but not impossible.
- XP rewards should be canonized through a questionnaire.
- Number of hit dice = level. Reroll hit dice every long rest.
- Keep 4 highest hit dice. This limits max HP to 24, but the average moves up.
- Why? Long form play benefits from a bit of traditional advancement.

### XP Award System
1 Award = 100 XP

### XP Questionnaire
- [ ] (1 Award) Did you **show up** to the table? 
- [ ] (1 Award) Did you help your party make progress toward their **goal**?
- [ ] (1 Award) Did you make progress toward your personal **ambition**?
- [ ] (1 Award) Did you **inspire** anyone?
- [ ] (1 Award) Did you **discover** a new faction or location?
- [ ] (1 Award) Did your party perform a great **deed**?
- [ ] (GM's Award) Did your party make a significant **impact** on the world?
- [ ] (Begin with Inspiration) Were you voted as **most valuable player (MVP)**?

## Talent System
- Keep Cairn's diagetic and faction driven growth, but canonize it with talents.
- Talents will be canonized ways training and transformation can affect a character.
- Why? West Marches games require strong guidelines to make it easier for GMs to coordinate.

### Talents
#### COMBAT
| Talent | Requirement | Description |
| :----: | :---------: | ----------- |
| Tough  | Might > 9   | Roll a bonus die when rolling for hit dice and drop the lowest. |

## Saves
To make a MAW save, roll a d20. A result of 20 always succeeds, and a result of 1 always fails. A result less than or equal to your MAW score is a success where higher is better. Rolling above your MAW score is a failure, excluding 20.

A save is only rolled when the GM makes a call for it. Saves are typically and preferably made in response to player decisions.

### Pushing Rolls
If you roll above your MAW score but less than 20, the GM may give you the option to **push** the roll.

In this case, the GM presents the stakes: often losing an item, taking critical damage, or death. The stakes are always more dire than the cost of ordinary failure.

If you choose to push the roll, then roll again and take the new result. If you succeed, then you may give an ally **inspiration**. If you fail, then suffer the consequences.

**Note**. You may only make one push attempt per roll.

### Inspiration
Inspiration can be used to get a free reroll on any MAW save or proficiency roll.

You either have inspiration, or not. It is lost at the end of each session. Inspiration is granted by players who succeed a pushed roll, and also at the end of each session to the most valued player, in which case they begin their day with it.
