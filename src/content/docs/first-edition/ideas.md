# Ideas
This is where I keep some of my random ideas for development.

## Advancement
- Mausritter style leveling, capped at level 10
- XP growth curve should make reaching max level very difficult, but not impossible.
- XP rewards should be canonized through a questionnaire.
- Number of hit dice = level. Reroll hit dice every long rest.
- Keep 4 highest hit dice. This limits max HP to 24, but the average moves up.
- Why? Long form play benefits from a bit of traditional advancement.

### XP Award System
1 Award = 100 XP

### XP Questionnaire
- [ ] (1 Award) Did you **show up** to the table? 
- [ ] (1 Award) Did you help your party make progress toward their **goal**?
- [ ] (1 Award) Did you make progress toward your personal **ambition**?
- [ ] (1 Award) Did you **inspire** anyone?
- [ ] (1 Award) Did you **discover** a new faction or location?
- [ ] (1 Award) Did your party perform a great **deed**?
- [ ] (GM's Award) Did your party make a significant **impact** on the world?
- [ ] (Begin with Inspiration) Were you voted as **most valuable player (MVP)**?

## Talent System
- Keep Cairn's diagetic and faction driven growth, but canonize it with talents.
- Talents will be canonized ways training and transformation can affect a character.
- Why? West Marches games require strong guidelines to make it easier for GMs to coordinate.
