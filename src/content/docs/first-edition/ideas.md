description: A temporary list of random ideas.

This is where I keep some of my random ideas for development.

## Advancement
- Mausritter style leveling, capped at level 10
- XP growth curve should make reaching max level very difficult, but not impossible.
- XP rewards should be canonized through a questionnaire.
- Number of hit dice = level. Reroll hit dice every long rest.
- Keep 5 highest hit dice. This limits max HP to 30, but the average moves up.
- Why? Long form play benefits from a bit of traditional advancement.

| Level | Hit Dice | Proficiency |    Rank   | Experience  |
| :---: | :------: | :---------: | :-------- | :---------- |
|   1   |   1d6    |      1      | Novice    | 0           |
|   2   |   2d6    |      1      | Novice    | 1,000       |
|   3   |   3d6    |      1      | Novice    | 3,000       |
|   4   |   4d6    |      2      | Seasoned  | 6,000       |
|   5   |   5d6    |      2      | Seasoned  | 10,000      |
|   6   |  &#x2009; 5d6(+1)\* |      3      | Veteran   | 15,000      |
|   7   |  5d6(+2) |      3      | Veteran   | 25,000      |
|   8   |  5d6(+3) |      4      | Heroic    | 40,000      |
|   9   |  5d6(+4) |      4      | Heroic    | 60,000      |
|   10  |  5d6(+5) |      5      | Legendary | 100,000     |

**\*Note**. Xd6(+Y) means roll Y six sided dice and keep the X highest.


### XP Award System
1 Award = 100 XP

### XP Questionnaire
- [ ] (1 Award) Did you **show up** to the table? 
- [ ] (1 Award) Did you **inspire** anyone?
- [ ] (1 Award) Did you **discover** a new faction or location?
- [ ] (1 Award) Did you help your party make progress toward their **goal**?
- [ ] (1 Award) Did you make progress toward your personal **ambition**?
- [ ] (1--5 Awards) Did your party achieve their **goal**?
- [ ] (1--5 Awards) Did your party perform a great **deed**?
- [ ] (1--5 Awards) Did your party make a significant **impact** on the world?
- [ ] (Begin with Inspiration) Were you voted as **most valuable player (MVP)**?

## Aspect System
- Keep Cairn's diagetic and faction driven growth, but canonize it with aspects.
- Aspects will be canonized ways training and transformation can affect a character.
- Why? West Marches games require strong guidelines to make it easier for GMs to coordinate.

#### Social

## Weapons
* Swords gain bonus to parry.
* Axes always deal condition damage to shields.
* Hammers and maces ignore some amount of armor.
* Polearms have reach and can be set against charging enemies to deal enhanced damage.
* Flails ignore shields and parry defense but harm the user for half damage on a max hit.

## Saves
To make a MAW save, roll a d20. A result of 20 always succeeds, and a result of 1 always fails. A result less than or equal to your MAW score is a success where higher is better. Rolling above your MAW score is a failure, excluding 20.

A save is only rolled when the GM makes a call for it. Saves are typically made in response to player decisions.

A result of 20 is the best possible outcome, and puts your player character in a better position.
Conversely, a result of 1 is the worst possible outcome, and puts your player character in a worse position.

### Pushing Rolls
If you roll above your MAW score but less than 20, the GM may give you the option to **push** the roll.

In this case, the GM presents the stakes: often losing an item, taking critical damage, or death. The stakes are always more dire than the cost of ordinary failure.

If you choose to push the roll, then roll again and take the new result. If you succeed, then you may give an ally **inspiration**. If you fail, then suffer the consequences.

**Note**. You may only make one push attempt per roll.


### Free Rerolls
When making a free reroll, you must accept the new result.

### Inspiration
Inspiration can be used to get a free reroll on any MAW save or proficiency roll.

You either have inspiration, or not. It is lost at the end of each session. Inspiration is granted by players who succeed a pushed roll, and also at the end of each session to the most valued player, in which case they begin their day with it.


## Proficiency
Your proficiency rating is half of your level, rounded down.

Backgrounds provide proficiency in a number of skills.

When the player attempts an action that requires proficiency, they automatically succeed if they have the skill. For particularly hard tasks, the GM may call for a proficiency check.

To perform a proficiency check, roll 1d6. If the result is less than or equal to your proficiency rating, you succeed, otherwise you fail.

If the player does not have the proficiency, either the GM allows a 1-in-6 chance or disallows the roll if it is impossible.

## Advantage & Disadvantage
When making a roll with **advantage**, roll two dice and take the better result. For **disadvantage**, take the worse result. Advantage and disadvantage is granted by the GM based on circumstance and clever play.
